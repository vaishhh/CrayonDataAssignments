As science grows, so does technology. Technological advances have helped people to live simpler. We all should incorporate technology into our lives as long as it’s something useful. The usage of technology depends on how we use it educationally and professionally. In future, having a tool like that really makes us successful and able to achieve goals or anything that we work on.  
As we know coin has two sides Good and Bad. Technology has also both side, we need to use it properly. We need to make sure that the technology is safe for use, does not affects one's health condition and the data being shared is secured.
I would like to mention about two major inventions where technology failed.

First one is the most popularly known "**Full Self Driving Cars**" introduced by Tesla. it offers driver-assist features that require users to agree that they must remain alert at the steering wheel in case they need to take over. And while the feature may sound fantastical beyond the wow factor, the drivers are often unsure of what their cars will do next. It is a terrifying prospect when you're behind the wheel of a vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds.   
The factors that make us fear in this invention are the risk that is caused due to _machine error_, _security issues_ since the car can be hacked at any point of time and _moral machine dilemma_ in unexpected situations.

The next invention that comes to my mind is "**Google Glass**". Customers always loved the Wearable technology like smart watch, medical alert monitors etc. This technology required lengthy battery life, improved image-recognition capabilities, and a lot of data. Google invented its glass for coolness. However, the coolness associated with an invention assumes the element of faith and as we know art isn’t easy in technology. Also this might cause an _eye strain_ or develop a headache when wearing the device. The glass may reduce your _natural peripheral vision_.  
Sitting in front of a Television for longer hours is not 
really a healthy activity. Similarily watching videos/ reading messages inside your glass also causes health issues. Though the invention is cool it is not “clinically meaningful”.

Along with life safety and health measures, there is one more important factor that need to be addressed is **Data security**. In this new socializing world, 
all the netorking sites invite users to share more information and this oversharing has become accepted practise. This may cause a huge disaster since there is a term in Technology that _if it can be developed then it can be hacked or destroyed too_. 

>The technology which is developed for people's use must be approved/denied by the people. Unless it is always a failure.
